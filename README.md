# Udacity Portfolio Project

The project cannot be viewed as a file:// URL (can't be opened directly from the browser, it has to be viewed as a server.) THis is a limitation of Polymer and how I implemented the project viewer.

To view the portfolio run a server using Python on the root of the repository like so:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

if that doesn't work or you know you have python 3 installed the command changes to:

`python3 -m http.server`

the project is live at [https://caraya.github.io/usacity-portfolio](https://caraya.github.io/usacity-portfolio). I've deleted the master branch to make sure the repo complies with Udacity's 100k files limit.
