Container for flexbox-based image gallery. Used [this codepen](http://codepen.io/caraya/full/NGoWKM/) as inspiration and the basis for this element.

You should also look at the [Flexbox layout with iron-flex-layout guide](https://elements.polymer-project.org/guides/flex-layout) and the [complete guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for reference.

One last element to note. When creating the styles you will have to create one additional piercing selector to make this work. I had to style the `.gallery-content` class from the custom element with the following selector so I could apply the `iron-flex-layout` mixins from the custom element and make the gallery wrap as designed:

    .gallery > ::content .gallery-content {}

Example:

    <athena-gallery>
      <div class="gallery-content">
        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/32795/love-the-architecture-01-1024x768.jpg" alt="Architecture in Amsterdam rocks" />
          <h3>The architecture rocks</h3>

          <p>...</p>
        </div>

        Add additional gallery items here

      </div>
    </athena-gallery>

As long as you keep the `gallery-item` class you can use other elements as well. For the original use case of image galleries I could use `figure` and `figcaption`. It has a better semantic fit with the use case and it should work better with assistive technology.

It is also good to point out that you don't need media queries for this element as flexbox is responsive by default.

@element athena-gallery

      .gallery {
        margin: .5vw;
        padding: .5vw;
      }

      .gallery > ::content .gallery-content {
        @apply(--layout-horizontal);
        @apply(--layout-wrap);
      }
